# Getting Started

To get this project running locally, clone the repository and run `npm install` followed by `npm start`. The `npm` commands are used here primarily to start a local server using the `server` package. If you already have a server setup you prefer, feel free to use that instead.

You can also run without a server by enabling `use-hash` in the `router` component, which uses hash-based routing. This method is used in our GitHub Pages live demo: [Vanilla.js Patterns Live Demo](https://quantuminformation.github.io/vanillajs-patterns/).
